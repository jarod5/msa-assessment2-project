# MSA Assessent 1 Project

The simulated device is in the form of a python script at `simulated-devices/Device.py`. It used the connection string to connect to msa-assessment2-project-hub (the project's IoT Hub on Azure). The hub then used a stream analytics job to stream the data to Power BI. I then created a report on Power BI called msaAssessment2Project. This report contains a few visualisations using the data, as well as some text explanations, demonstrating how similar data collected from actual IoT devices could be used (although it is just for demonstartive purposes).

## Note for MSA

This github is attached to my univeristy email jarod.cunningham@students.mq.edu.au (as is my microsoft learn account, Azure account, and Power BI account), while I registered to MSA using a personal email of jarodlc@hotmail.com

I hope this doesn't cause too much confusion or difficulty
